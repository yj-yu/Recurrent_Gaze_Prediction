# RGP

This project hosts the code for our **CVPR 2017** paper.

The RGP stands for *Recurrent Gaze Prediction* module for gaze prediction.
The recurrent gaze prediction (RGP) model learns from human gaze to predict which parts of scenes to be focused.

# VAS

VAS is newly collected dataset, consisting of movie clips, and corresponding multiple descriptive sentences along with human gaze tracking data.
You can download dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6JnKeZoakNCR3FlaVpiS252VXc)
Please read README.md file in VAS.zip
